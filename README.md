# Generative AI Lab – 1

This repository contains **Generative AI Lab–1 submissions**, demonstrating practical usage of **AI tools for content creation, prompt engineering, and multimedia generation**.  
The lab is divided into **two parts**, each focusing on a different real-world application of Generative AI.

---

## Lab Objectives

- Understand **prompt engineering** for text, image, and video generation  
- Apply **Generative AI tools** to real-world use cases  
- Organize AI workflows in a **structured, reproducible manner**  
- Document AI-generated outputs clearly for academic evaluation
