Prompt:
Create a single vertical professional digital poster for a Kannada Rajyotsava celebration.
Text requirements (STRICT – do not alter):
Top (centered):
Kannada Rajyotsava
Sambrama
Middle (clear and minimal):
Date: 7th November 2025
Time: 2:00 PM onwards
Venue: College Ground
Do not add any additional text, captions, or placeholders.
Background & Layout:
* Use a warm yellow and deep red color palette
* Include a soft translucent background featuring traditional South Indian / Karnataka temple architecture (temple gopura or stone carvings), subtle and elegant
* The background should feel layered and airy, not heavy or flat
Cultural Visual Elements (well-integrated, not boxed):
* Professional Dollu Kunitha performers with energetic drumming in traditional attire
* A vibrant Yakshagana performance with expressive poses and elaborate costumes
* Traditional Karnataka musical instruments (chende, veena, mridanga) being played live
* A group performing cultural skits, showing expressive stage storytelling
All performers should be naturally blended into the design, with smooth transitions and depth — not rigid grid or collage boxes.
Additional Elements:
* Place a small college logo neatly at the top corner, formal and unobtrusive
Style Guidelines:
* Realistic, high-resolution photography style
* Professional, dignified, and culturally rich
* Suitable for an official university cultural event poster
* Avoid cartoon or animated styles
* Balanced composition similar to a premium cultural festival poster
